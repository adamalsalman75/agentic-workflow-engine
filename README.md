# Agentic Workflow Engine

A Spring Boot application that uses AI agents to break down complex goals into tasks, execute them, and provide comprehensive summaries. Built with Java 24, Spring AI, and OpenAI integration.

## Architecture

The system uses a **pure orchestration pattern** with clean service separation and AI agent integration:

## Prerequisites

- Java 24 (with preview features enabled)
- PostgreSQL database
- OpenAI API key
- Maven 3.6+

## Setup

### 1. Database Setup

Start PostgreSQL using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will create a PostgreSQL database with:
- Database: `agentic_workflow`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `password`
- Port: `5432`

### 2. Environment Variables

Set your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
```

### 3. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the application
./mvnw clean compile

# Run the application
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`

## API Usage

The workflow engine provides an async API with instant response and real-time progress tracking.

### 1. Start Workflow Execution

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/workflow/execute`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "query": "Your goal or task description here"
}
```

**Response (Instant):**
```json
{
  "goalId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "message": "Workflow execution started"
}
```

The workflow executes asynchronously in virtual threads. Use the returned `goalId` to track progress.

### 2. Check Goal Status

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/workflow/goal/{goalId}`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "query": "Your original query",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "task-uuid-1",
      "description": "Task description",
      "result": "Task execution result",
      "status": "COMPLETED",
      "blockingDependencies": [],
      "informationalDependencies": [],
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
      "completedAt": "2024-01-01T10:05:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "AI-generated summary of the workflow execution",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "completedAt": "2024-01-01T10:10:00Z"
}
```

### 3. Check Task Progress

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/workflow/goal/{goalId}/tasks`

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "task-uuid-1",
    "description": "Research coffee shop market",
    "result": "Market research completed...",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "blockingDependencies": [],
    "informationalDependencies": [],
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "completedAt": "2024-01-01T10:02:00Z"
  },
  {
    "id": "task-uuid-2", 
    "description": "Develop business plan",
    "result": null,
    "status": "PENDING",
    "blockingDependencies": ["task-uuid-1"],
    "informationalDependencies": [],
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
    "completedAt": null
  }
]
```

### Task Status Values
- `PENDING` - Task created but not yet started
- `IN_PROGRESS` - Task currently executing (internal use)
- `COMPLETED` - Task finished successfully

## Complete Workflow Examples

The workflow engine demonstrates two key capabilities: **parallel execution** for independent tasks and **dependency-aware sequential execution** for dependent tasks.

## Example 1: Parallel Execution (Paris Travel Planning)

Independent tasks that can run simultaneously:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "I am planning a 3-day trip to Paris. Can you create a travel plan for me? The plan should include a suggested daily itinerary, a list of 5 highly-rated French restaurants, and a summary of the public transportation options available"
  }'
```

**Result: All 3 tasks execute in parallel** ‚ö°

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Research and create a suggested daily itinerary for the 3-day trip to Paris.",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "blockingDependencies": [],
    "completedAt": "2025-07-27T07:21:32.191606Z"
  },
  {
    "description": "Compile a list of 5 highly-rated French restaurants in Paris.",
    "status": "COMPLETED", 
    "blockingDependencies": [],
    "completedAt": "2025-07-27T07:21:36.290143Z"
  },
  {
    "description": "Summarize the public transportation options available in Paris.",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "blockingDependencies": [],
    "completedAt": "2025-07-27T07:21:31.585999Z"
  }
]
```

## Example 2: Dependency-Aware Sequential Execution (Coffee Shop Business)

Dependent tasks that must execute in logical order:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/workflow/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Help me start a coffee shop business including market research, business plan, permits, and initial setup"
  }'
```

**Result: Smart sequential execution based on dependencies** üß†

```json
[
  {
    "description": "Conduct market research to understand target audience, competition, and location feasibility.",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "blockingDependencies": [],
    "completedAt": "2025-07-27T07:23:21.142896Z"
  },
  {
    "description": "Create a comprehensive business plan including financial projections, marketing strategy, and operational plan.",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "blockingDependencies": ["d8459ff3-214c-4e81-9057-970444086e2a"]
  },
  {
    "description": "Obtain necessary permits and licenses to legally operate the coffee shop.",
    "status": "COMPLETED",
    "informationalDependencies": ["102ac44a-05ce-4862-8580-51b54eff582f"],
    "completedAt": "2025-07-27T07:23:16.129208Z"
  },
  {
    "description": "Identify and secure a location for the coffee shop.",
    "status": "COMPLETED", 
    "informationalDependencies": ["d8459ff3-214c-4e81-9057-970444086e2a"],
    "completedAt": "2025-07-27T07:23:15.619491Z"
  },
  {
    "description": "Set up the coffee shop's physical space, including interior design, equipment purchase, and installation.",
    "status": "PENDING",
    "blockingDependencies": ["cb1b29fe-2fc3-4c4a-98e1-58ae3b8ed9f5"]
  }
]
```

```bash
./mvnw clean package
java --enable-preview -jar target/agentic-workflow-engine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

### Database Schema

The application automatically creates the required database schema on startup:

- `goals` table - Stores workflow goals and summaries  
- `tasks` table - Stores individual tasks with dependency information
- `task_dependencies` table - Stores detailed dependency relationships

## How Parallel Execution Works

The system intelligently executes tasks in parallel based on their dependencies:

### Dependency Types
- **Blocking Dependencies**: Task cannot start until these dependencies complete
- **Informational Dependencies**: Task can start but benefits from these dependency results

### Key Benefits

‚úÖ **Pure Orchestration**: Orchestrator focuses only on coordination, no business logic  
‚úÖ **Service Encapsulation**: Each service has single responsibility and clear boundaries  
‚úÖ **AI Agent Isolation**: Agents wrapped by services, not directly accessed by orchestrator  
‚úÖ **Independent Testing**: Each service can be tested in isolation with comprehensive coverage  
‚úÖ **Enterprise Architecture**: Clean layering suitable for large-scale applications  
‚úÖ **Parallel Efficiency**: Intelligent dependency resolution maximizes concurrent execution

## Logging

The application provides comprehensive logging at DEBUG level:

- Task planning and creation
- Individual task execution progress
- Plan reviews and updates
- Final summaries and execution times
- Error handling and debugging information

## Java 24 Features

This application leverages Java 24 preview features:

- **StructuredTaskScope** - For structured concurrency and virtual threads
- **Virtual Threads** - For efficient async operations
- **Preview Features** - Enabled via `--enable-preview` flag

## Architecture Principles

- **Pure Orchestration Pattern** - Orchestrator contains zero business logic, only coordinates services
- **Service-Based Architecture** - Each service encapsulates specific business concerns
- **AI Agent Encapsulation** - Agents wrapped by services for clean separation
- **Immutable Records** - All domain models use immutable Java records for thread safety
- **Virtual Threads** - Async operations use virtual threads over reactive programming
- **Spring Data JDBC** - Simple, direct database access through shared persistence layer
- **PostgreSQL** - Reliable, scalable database storage
- **Structured Concurrency** - Better async code organization and error handling
- **Enterprise Layering** - Clear separation between orchestration, business logic, and infrastructure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Preview API warnings** - These are expected when using Java 24 preview features
2. **Database connection errors** - Ensure PostgreSQL is running and accessible
3. **OpenAI API errors** - Verify your API key is set and has sufficient credits
4. **Compilation errors** - Ensure Java 24 is installed and `--enable-preview` is configured
